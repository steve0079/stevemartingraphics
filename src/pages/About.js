      <h1 className="title">About:</h1>
      <p className="aboutBody">I have extensive experience with digital and print design for the hospitality, travel & leisure, food & beverage, and electronic industries, among others. I am wired to work in a creative, fast-paced environment producing quality work with the most efficient turnaround time. In addition, I have helped develop a variety of brand and corporate identities through the marketing elements of websites, landing pages, banner ads, email blasts, social media, print advertisements, sales collateral, and direct mail. I have over 20 years of experience in photo manipulation and retouching, and I have been certified with the ADA-compliance laws for creating accessible PDFs. I have two years of experience as a front-end web developer, and I am continually learning new skills, including full-stack developing and staying current with industry standards. I value the clients goals and visions, and seek to exceed their expectations on each and every project. I have won awards, including the "2015 Marketing Team of the Year" award with Pacific Hospitality Group.</p>
      <p className="aboutBody">When I'm not catching my breath from my high energy work style and efforts, I'm out walking my three lab mix rescue dogs with my family. I am also a third generation Veteran and still I love to be of service to others today.</p>
