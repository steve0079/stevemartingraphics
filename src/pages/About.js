      <p className="aboutBody">I have extensive experience with print and digital design for the hospitality, travel & Leisure, and food & beverage industries. I am wired to work in a creative, fast-paced environment producing quality work with the most efficient turnaround time. Also, Ihave helped develop a variety of brand and corporate identities through the marketing elements of print advertisements, sales collateral, direct mail, websites, landing pages, banner ads, email blasts and social media. In addition to my design skills, I have over 20 years of experience in photo manipulation and retouching, and recently I've become certified in making PDFs accessible in accordance with the ADA compliance. I value the clients goals and visions, and seeks to exceed their expectations on each and every job. I have won awards, including most recent, the 2015 Marketing Team of the Year award with Pacific Hospitality Group.</p>
      <p className="aboutBody">I continually do education certifications to stay current with industry standards, and when I'm not catching my breath from my high energy work style and efforts, I'm out walking my three lab mix rescue dogs with my family. I am also a third generation Veteran and still I love to be of service to others today.</p>
